# Overview
Data engineering has contributed immensely to the advancement of biology and medicine. Various AI-based solutions are proposed and implemented for decision-making. However, the widespread adoption of AI as a frequent tool in decision-making that has tangible impacts on patient well-being is still far from achieving its potential due to the controversy of outsourcing the health and medical decision-making processes to black-box AI methods. Therefore, fairness and explainability are two factors that are desirable by biologists and medical practitioners. Recent research has focused on producing AI methods that are both transparent and can cater to improving societal equity in their respective domains. With this in mind, we consider the advances made in fairness and explainability of AI in medical and biological applications. We conceive it vital that they are considered in generalisable engineering solutions. Accordingly, this workshop focuses on methods suitable for developing fair and explainable AI-based solutions for biology and medicine.

**The workshop will be held virtually on 29th July 2022.** <span style="color:blue"> **REGISTRATION IS FREE** </span>
